PrognosAI

AI-Based Predictive Maintenance & Health Prognostics System

Project Overview

PrognosAI is an AI-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) system designed to predict the health status and degradation trends of complex systems using time-series sensor data. The project leverages deep learning (GRU – Gated Recurrent Units) trained on the NASA C-MAPSS dataset to model failure patterns and enable early fault prediction.

This system is particularly applicable to predictive maintenance, where timely detection of degradation can reduce downtime, maintenance costs, and unexpected failures.
